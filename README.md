### Background

Both machine learning and NLP are disrupting finance to improve customer service. Robo advisors are an application that is surely making a major impact across the industry. Here I have created a robo advisor leveraging Amazon Web Services via Lex and Lambda that could be used by customers to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.

This repo contains the following:
1) RoboAdvisor Lex bot zip file
2) RoboAdvisor video demo
3) Lambda function
4) Test cases
